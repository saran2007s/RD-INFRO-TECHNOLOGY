# RD INFRO TECHNOLOGY – Data Science Internship Projects (June–July 2025)

This repository showcases the hands-on projects I completed during my 4-week **virtual Data Science Internship** at [RD INFRO TECHNOLOGY](https://rdinfrotechnology.netlify.app), from **24th June 2025 to 23rd July 2025**.

The internship involved building and deploying machine learning models on real-world datasets using core data science techniques. Each project was developed independently, documented in Jupyter Notebooks, and summarized in a project-specific PDF file.
